visionplayer
============

VisionPlayer is a Embedded Vision Project build for the Embedded Vision Minor HAN (http://www.han.nl/)

The device plays audio from a drawn sketch folded around a cilinder.

A complementary stepper motor control is used to rotate the cilinder at a speed read from 7 segments symbols on the sketch.
